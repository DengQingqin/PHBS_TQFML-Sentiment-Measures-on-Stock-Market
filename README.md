##Project: Sentiment Measures on Stock Market

##Project Goal:
    *Try to predict whether the stock price would go up or down compared to the stock index, for example SCI 300 Index. The sentiment measures model is popular in stock price prediction. So I would like to apply some machine learning methods to see whether it would work efficiently.
    
##Date Sources:
    *Wind Financial Database
    
##Method:
    *Mainly SVM and Logistic regression. PCA and linear regression may be used to filtrate the factors.
    
##More Details:
    *1. Choose some sentiment factors that may reflect the future change of the SCI 300 Index, and try to obtain the data of as much as I can.
    *2. Select some effective factors by linear regression or PCA.
    *3. Define two states of SCI 300 Index, rising (upward) and falling (downward). Apply SVM and Logistic regression to carrying out the classification.
    *4. Check the accuracy of the method. If itâ€™s accurate, try to apply it to the futures market. If not, try to find some other sentiment factors and do it again.
